	<h1>Time,Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
      Time complexity is a measure of how the computation time of an algorithm grows with the size of the input. 
      It helps programmers determine how efficient an algorithm is when processing large datasets. 
      A lower time complexity indicates that an algorithm can solve problems faster, making it more suitable for high-performance applications.
    </p>
	<p>
      <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses while running relative to the size of its input. 
      For example, an algorithm that requires additional memory proportional to its input size has a space complexity of <strong>O(n)</strong>. 
      Understanding space requirements is crucial for designing scalable and memory-efficient systems.
